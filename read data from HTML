## The two main ways to work with HTML files are:

1. Saving the HTML file to your computer (using the Requests library for example) library and 
reading that file into a BeautifulSoup constructor
2. Reading the HTML response content directly into a BeautifulSoup constructor (again using the Requests library for example)
